the booking, length of stay, the number of adults, children, or babies, and the number of available parking
spaces, among other things.<br />

● Which was the busiest month for hotels?<br />
● Most guests came from which country?<br />
● How long do most people stay in hotels?<br />
● Which was the most booked accommodation type (Single, Couple, Family)?<br />
